*Eight language-agnostic principles for reasoning about correctness and attacking programs with adversarial tests, indexed for navigation.*

# Engineering Philosophy — Map of Content

How to **reason about, design, and test** software. The working method by which workspace architecture and code-level practices are applied.

## The thesis (one sentence)

> Write programs so their correctness is **explainable to a human**, then **attack them with adversarial tests** aimed at the strange, brittle, neglected corners that ordinary usage will not exercise.

This is in the spirit of Donald Knuth's approach to correctness, testability, and long-term reliability.

## The eight principles

1. [[Human Understanding First]] — narratable design; expose invariants
2. [[Reason About Correctness]] — argue for it; don't hope for it
3. [[Normal Usage Is Not Testing]] — typical use only exercises the obvious paths
4. [[Tests Should Make Programs Fail]] — adversarial testing finds important bugs
5. [[Sharp Oracles]] — exact, decisive correctness criteria; never "looks right"
6. [[Regression Discipline]] — every bug strengthens the suite, permanently
7. [[Explicit Not Magical]] — clarity over cleverness; debuggable by inspection
8. [[Reasoning Beside Code]] — produce the surrounding argument, not just code

## Output format

When designing or implementing non-trivial work, follow the structure documented in [[Output Format]]:

1. **Correctness model** — what the system must guarantee
2. **Invariants and assumptions** — the load-bearing claims
3. **Design and implementation** — the actual code
4. **Test strategy** — split into ordinary, edge, adversarial, and regression tests, each annotated with the failure class it targets

## How this composes with the other sections

| Section | Answers |
|---|---|
| [[Workspace Architecture MOC]] | **What does the system look like?** Crate layout, boundaries, deployable units. |
| [[Rust Practices MOC]] | **What does good Rust code look like?** Idioms, type-driven design, error handling, test levels. |
| **Engineering Philosophy** (this section) | **How do we *reason and test* toward correctness?** The attitude with which the other two are applied. |

The architecture defines *what good looks like in the large*. The Rust practices define *what good looks like at the line level*. The engineering philosophy defines *how we know we've achieved either*.

The philosophy section is language-agnostic — it applies to any project, regardless of language or domain.
